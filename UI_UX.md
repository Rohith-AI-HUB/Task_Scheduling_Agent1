UI Framework Recommendation
Based on this aesthetic, I'd recommend:
Material UI (MUI) - Best fit because:

Clean, modern component library
Excellent customization through theme system
Built-in support for this color scheme style
Smooth animations and transitions
Great for data-heavy apps like task schedulers

Alternative Options:

Chakra UI - If you want more out-of-the-box warmth
Ant Design - For more structured, enterprise feel
Tailwind CSS - Maximum customization flexibility
